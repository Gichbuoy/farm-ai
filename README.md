# ðŸŒ¾ Farm-AI: Crop Disease Detection and Prevention Tool

## Introduction
**Farm-AI** is an AI-powered tool designed to assist farmers in identifying and preventing crop diseases. By using image analysis and question-answering capabilities, Farm-AI enables farmers to upload photos of potentially diseased crops, receive diagnoses, and get information on disease prevention and treatment. The project aims to improve crop health and productivity, ultimately empowering farmers with actionable insights.

## Inspiration
The inspiration for **Farm-AI** came from the struggles of small-scale farmers who often face crop diseases without access to timely expertise. Many of these farmers are unable to identify diseases early on, leading to crop loss and reduced yields. By providing an accessible AI tool, **Farm-AI** empowers local farmers to diagnose crop diseases by simply uploading images of infected crops. This tool offers valuable insights on treatment and prevention, ultimately improving crop health and productivity.

## What it Does
**Farm-AI** enables farmers to:
- **Upload images of infected crops** for disease analysis. The AI processes the image, identifies potential diseases, and provides a diagnosis.
- **Ask additional questions** related to disease prevention and treatment methods through a built-in Q&A feature, making the tool an all-in-one resource for managing crop health.

The tool is built to provide accurate, AI-driven analysis and recommendations, helping farmers make informed decisions on crop management to prevent and mitigate the effects of diseases.

## How We Built It
**Farm-AI** leverages the **Gemini API** to power both image analysis and question-answering functionalities. The main components include:
- **Frontend**: Built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, the user interface is designed to be intuitive and accessible for local farmers, even those with minimal tech skills.
- **Backend**: Scripts are used to integrate the Gemini API, which powers the crop image analysis and answers questions from farmers.
- **Machine Learning & Deployment**:
  - **Google AI Studio** was used to train the model on various crop diseases, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of diseases.
  - **Vertex AI** handles deployment, providing a scalable and reliable platform for serving AI predictions.
- **Nix**: A cross-platform package manager, Nix was used for managing dependencies and ensuring consistency across environments.
